# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection System implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The system aims to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions through machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Analyzes historical credit card transaction data.
- Provides accurate predictions based on learned patterns.
- Can be integrated into existing financial systems for real-time monitoring.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd CreditCardFraudDetection
   
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. Make sure to download and place the dataset in the data directory.

## Model Training

The machine learning models are trained using the train_model.ipynb notebook. Execute this notebook to train and save the models.

## Results

The results of the fraud detection system, including accuracy and other performance metrics, are presented in the notebook and can be further analyzed for system improvement.
